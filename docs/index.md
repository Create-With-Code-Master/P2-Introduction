In this unit, you will program a top-down game with the objective of throwing food to hungry animals - who are stampeding towards you - before they can run past you.

As you build the prototype, you will become familiar with some of the most important programming and Unity concepts, including:
* if-then statements,
* random number generation,
* arrays,
* collision detection,
* prefabs,
* and instantiation.

By the time you complete this unit, you will know how to program a basic game with the ability to launch projectiles and maneuver the player to keep the game alive.
